          <h3>Piano</h3>
          <p>Starting in nearly kindergarten, I have been playing piano for over 10 years. What began as a childhood curiosity slowly grew into a true passion, one that has challenged me to be disciplined, creative, and expressive.</p>

          <h3>Squash</h3>
          <p>Squash is a little bit of an obscure sport, but it's very fun. I play to keep in shape and to have fun, although I do compete as well! Whether I‚Äôm playing casually with friends or in a more competitive setting, squash has become a way to balance my academic work with something active and energizing. It‚Äôs a sport that pushes me to improve constantly, while also keeping me grounded and healthy.

      <h2>Piano ‚Äî Details</h2>
<p>
  Throughout the years of playing piano, I've gained a lot of experience on stage, competing with other pianists, and pushing through challenges. Piano is grounding and allows me to reach people in ways that other activities may not. Beyond the competitions, however, the instrument has taught me patience and resilience ‚Äî learning a difficult piece often means spending weeks, sometimes months, perfecting just a few pages. Each performance has pushed me to manage nerves, refine my technique, and truly connect with the music. 
</p>
<p>
  Piano has also given me opportunities outside of competitions, such as playing for school events and family gatherings, where I‚Äôve seen how music can bring comfort and joy to others. Over time, it has become not just a hobby but also a way to share part of myself with the people around me.

      <h2>Squash ‚Äî Details</h2>
      <p>
    Competing in matches has given me valuable lessons about perseverance and focus. 
    Long rallies can be exhausting, but they‚Äôve taught me how to stay determined and 
    find energy even when I‚Äôm tired. Beyond competition, squash has been a great way 
    to connect with teammates, practice sportsmanship, and build resilience both on 
    and off the court.
